		description:
			"I'm a Computer Programming & Analysis student at George Brown College, still early in my development journey but genuinely motivated to improve. Most of my experience comes from coursework and small projects using PHP, Java, C#, JavaScript, SQL, and ASP.NET MVC. I'm steadily getting better at understanding how data moves through an application and how to structure code more cleanly.",

	about: {
		title: "I'm Junyong Choi, a student developer who values consistency, patience, and a willingness to learn.",
		description:
			"I have implemented basic CRUD features, form-handling logic, simple authentication/session flows, and built database schemas based on project requirements. I'm still building confidence in back-end logic, but I always make an effort to be clear, responsible, and open to feedback. What I lack in experience, I try to make up for with a genuine desire to grow as a developer.",
